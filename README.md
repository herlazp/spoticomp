This Spotify data visualization project extracts and analyzes metrics of songs from a specific band, comparing them to popular songs in the same genre. Using Dash and Plotly, an interactive application will be developed to display up to 8 key metrics. The application will be deployed on GitHub Pages, making it easily accessible and shareable.
